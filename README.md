# Members only project

**This project is to practice MVC, RESTful routes, authentication and authority.**
In this project, the main page has serveral posts posted by members. Only members can see the author of each post.
This website does not allow to create new user but does allow each user to create a new post.

###What I practice in this project:

- MVC (Model - View - Controller)
- Basic model assosication: belongs_to, has_many
- Basic unit test: integartion test
- Form: using form_for
- Authentication: session and cookies
- Style the webpages using Bootstrap

This is members-only project offered by The Odin project. To get more information, follow this [link](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication)
